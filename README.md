# ItemSubjector
*Work in progress*

Tool made to add main subject statements to 
items based on the title using a home-brewed 
CirrusSearch-based Named Entity Recognition algorithm. 

# Thanks
During the development of this tool the author got a 
help multiple times from *Jan Ainali* and *Jon SÃ¸by*
with figuring out how to query the API using the 
CirrusSearch extensions and to remove more 
specific main subjects from the query results.

# Installation
Clone the repo and run

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

to install all requirements.

# Setup
Like my other tools, copy config.example.py -> 
config.py and enter the botusername 
(e.g. So9q@itemsubjector) and password
